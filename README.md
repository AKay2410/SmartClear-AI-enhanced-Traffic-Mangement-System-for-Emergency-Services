# SmartClear-AI-traffic-Mangement-System-for-Emergency-Services

SmartClear project aims at addressing this gap through coming up with automated traffic signal preemption system suitable for emergency vehicles only. SmartClear helps in pro- viding real-time 
support to on-site traffic management by using big data analytics together with AI. At the moment, current traffic management is urban-handled signals that change timing based on sensor data. 
Nevertheless, these “traffic responsive” systems are not good at adapting to real-time demand. However, when connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) emerged, it brought possibilities for improvement 
since there can be proactive communication between the traffic system and the vehicle. Still, this is expected to take some time before a large number of people adopt CAV technology. Hence, in the meantime, 
local areas will need to manage their CAV systems in quite similar ways as existent “traffic responsive” systems. Emergency services face a unique challenge in that, while general traffic 
management is well-studied, the dynamic nature of traffic conditions constantly changes. Emergency service requirements are not considered by existing systems, which depend on predetermined ways of 
removing obstacles from the roads and thus could block emergency routes. In addition, these systems struggle to adjust to real-time changes because it takes long to re-optimize them. To address this 
challenge, SmartClear has devised effective methods of managing traf- fic that specifically suit emergency services, prioritizes road clearance planning and utilizes current traffic details.
